               <p class="text-small">  COVID‑19 vaccine</b> is a vaccine intended to provide acquired <b>immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2)</b>, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). Prior to the COVID‑19 pandemic, an established body of knowledge existed about the structure and function of coronaviruses causing diseases like<b> severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)</b> and <b>Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)</b>. This knowledge accelerated the development of various vaccine platforms during early 2020. The initial focus of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was on preventing symptomatic, often severe illness. The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread, severity, and death caused by COVID-19.

            <p class="selectionSubTag  text-small">  Near By MeAnother productive way to use this tool to begin a daily writing routine. 
            One way is to generate a random paragraph with the intention to try to  
            rewrite it while still keeping the original meaning. The purpose here is to just get the writing started so that when the writer goes onto their day's 
            writing projects, words are already flowing from their fingers.It's not only writers who can benefit from this free online tool. If you're a programmer who's working on a project where blocks of text are needed, 
            this tool can be a great way to get that. It's a good way to test your programming and that the tool being created is working well.
            Above are a few examples of how the random paragraph generator can be beneficial. The best way to see if this random paragraph picker will be useful for your intended purposes is to give it a try. Generate a number of 
            paragraphs to see if they are beneficial to your current project.If you do find this paragraph tool useful, please do us a favor and let us know how you're using it. It's greatly beneficial for us to know the different ways this tool is being used so we can improve it with updates. 
            This is especially true since there are times when the generators we create get used in completely unanticipated ways from when we initially created them. If you have the time, please send us a quick note on what you'd like to see 
            changed or added to make it better in the future.</p>
