        <h1>What is Balanced Diet?</h1>
        <p class="info-color">There are four key essential nutrients that make up a balanced diet. Top of the list is fruits and vegetables, which need to be consumed every day in vast quantities. Proteins, fiber-rich carbs and good fats make up the other three components to a balanced diet. Letâ€™s take a look at the benefits of each of these, and the best ways to incorporate each of them in your diet.<br><br><b>1.Fruits and vegetables:</b> Fruit and vegetables are a good source of vitamins and minerals, including folate, vitamin C and potassium. They're an excellent source of dietary fibre, which can help to maintain a healthy gut and prevent constipation and other digestion problems. A diet high in fibre can also reduce your risk of bowel cancer.<br><br><b>2.Protein:</b> Protein is an important part of a healthy diet. Proteins are made up of chemical 'building blocks' called amino acids. Your body uses amino acids to build and repair muscles and bones and to make hormones and enzymes. They can also be used as an energy source.<br><br><b>3.Carbohydrates:</b> Carbohydrates are your body's main source of energy: They help fuel your brain, kidneys, heart muscles, and central nervous system. For instance, fiber is a carbohydrate that aids in digestion, helps you feel full, and keeps blood cholesterol levels in check. Your body can store extra carbohydrates in your muscles and liver for use when you're not getting enough carbohydrates in your diet.<br><br><b>4. Fats:</b>Carbohydrates are your body's main source of energy: They help fuel your brain, kidneys, heart muscles, and central nervous system. For instance, fiber is a carbohydrate that aids in digestion, helps you feel full, and keeps blood cholesterol levels in check. Your body can store extra carbohydrates in your muscles and liver for use when you're not getting enough carbohydrates in your diet.<br> </p>

        <h1>Mental Health</h1>
        <p class="info-color">Mental health is  an integral part of health; it is more than the absence of mental illnesses. It is the foundation for well-being and effective functioning of individuals. It includes mental well-being, prevention of mental disorders, treatment and rehabilitation.
          WHO estimates that the burden of mental health problems in India is 2443 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per 100 00 population; the age-adjusted suicide rate per 100 000 population is 21.1. The economic loss due to mental health conditions, between 2012-2030, is estimated at USD 1.03 trillion.
        <br><br>Determinants of mental health include individual attributes such as the ability to manage one's thoughts, emotions, behaviours and interactions with others. In addition, social, cultural, economic, political and environmental factors have a role to play as do specific psychological and personality, and  genetic factors.
<br><br>
        Raising awareness and mobilizing efforts in support of mental health is necessary for addressing the situation.
        Mental health promotion involves creating an environment, which promotes healthy living and encourages people to adopt healthy lifestyle. Enabling environment through national mental health policies and legal frameworks are imperative for effective management of mental health disorders and providing overarching directions for ensuring mental health promotion. This calls for a multisectoral engagement and a life-course approach.
        <br><br>
        Treatment of mental health disorders is of utmost importance. It calls for comprehensive strategies for promotion, prevention, treatment and recovery through a whole-of-government approach.  Policy makers should be encouraged to promote availability of and access to cost-effective treatment of common mental disorders at the primary health care level.</p>
